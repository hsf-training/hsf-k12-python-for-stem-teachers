# Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop
This is the Programming for STEM Teachers Workshop repository. This is intended for people (mainly teachers) who are not familiar with programming at any level. The hope is that through this workshop we are able to enable STEM teachers with basic knowledge on Google Colab and Python such that they can further develop and complement their class with programming in any way.

## Pre-requisites for this Workshop

**Nothing** :D

All you need is a gmail account (and sometimes maybe not even that!)

## Getting Started

If you want to gather more information about what a notebook **is** then you might be interested in reading about what [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) is.

To begin with this workshop it is recommended that you look at the [First notebook](notebooks/1-Introduction_to_Markdown_and_Python.ipynb) to learn about the implementations of Markdown, LaTeX and Python inside Google Colab's version of a Jupyter Notebook.

When opening the notebook just click the <img src="colab-button.png" alt="Open In Colab" width="120"/> found on top of the file and you will instantly open the document online.

**Recommendation** MAKE A COPY BEFORE YOU START EDITING IT

Go to **File** --> **Save a copy in Drive...**



## If you want to run locally
### Installing Jupyter Notebook
**Two methods**
1. You can install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for python which is filled with all the packages you will need. **Recommended method**


2. Or you can manually install Jupyter Notebooks in your computer along with some basic packages as mentioned below. [Follow these instructions to install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

**You must have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your computer for Jupyter to work**



### Copying the files locally

If you have a command line with bash you can have a local copy of all the files that will be used in the workshop

Just do the following


*you can copy by either `ctrl-Shift-C` or simply by selecting the lines. You can paste in the command line by `ctrl-Shift-V` , `Shift-Ins` or `right-click`*

```shell
cd
git clone https://github.com/GuillermoFidalgo/Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop.git
cd Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop/
```

From here you can run all the notebooks used in this workshop.
